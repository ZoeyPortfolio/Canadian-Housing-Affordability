## Steps
### 1. Data Transformation and Cleaning
- Used Power Query in Power BI to conduct operations like pivot, unpivot, and appending.
- Leveraged DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to calculate weighted averages for key metrics such as Average Equity, Net Worth, and Household Income.

### 2. Data Visualization and Insights
The dashboard provides insights on various aspects of housing affordability, including:
- Income and Wealth Trends:
  - The top three provinces with the highest real average income are Alberta, Ontario, and British Columbia.

  - People who own without a mortgage tend to have more personal wealth, investments, and business assets compared to those who own with a mortgage.
  - Residents from British Columbia lead in personal wealth, investments, and business assets.
  - Individuals aged 55 to 64 have the highest investments, business assets, and overall wealth, while those aged 25 to 34 have the highest personal wealth in housing.

- Household Income Over Time:
  - Since 2006, household incomes across Canada have generally increased.
  - House owners' average household income peaked in 2020 before declining, while renters' income peaked in 2021 and then decreased.
  - Future forecasts suggest a rise in household incomes for both house owners and renters starting in 2022.

### 3. Actionable Insights for stakeholders
The data-driven decisions:
- Focus housing affordability policies on provinces with lower income levels or wealth accumulation to balance regional disparities. Tailor financial planning services for high-wealth individuals in British Columbia.
- Encourage mortgage-free homeownership through incentives like lump-sum payment options or financial literacy programs aimed at accelerating mortgage repayment.
  * To reduce the principal amount owed on a mortgage, lowering future interest payments and potentially shortening the loan term.
  * A lump-sum payment is a one-time, large payment made to settle an obligation, debt, or financial commitment in full or in part, instead of breaking it into smaller, periodic payments over time.
- Design financial products targeting young homeowners for wealth-building, while offering tailored investment opportunities for older age groups nearing retirement.
- Use projected income growth to inform affordable housing strategies, such as scaling rental assistance programs or introducing affordable homeownership plans during periods of income recovery.
- Develop investment education programs to help moderate-income households diversify into real estate and other asset classes, reducing wealth inequality.
