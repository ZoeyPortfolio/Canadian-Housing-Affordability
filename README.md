# ðŸ“Š Power BI Canadian Housing Affordability Dashboard
## Overview
This project is a volunteer data analysis initiative in collaboration with the GLOCAL Foundation of Canada. The Power BI dashboard is designed to analyze and visualize key trends in Canadian housing affordability, offering actionable insights for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and the general public.

## Tools and Technologies
- Power BI: Data visualization and dashboard design

## Data Sources
The dataset is sourced from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) website.

## Steps
### 1. Data Transformation and Cleaning
- Used Power Query in Power BI to conduct operations like pivot, unpivot, and appending.
- Leveraged DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to calculate weighted averages for key metrics such as Average Equity, Net Worth, and Household Income.

### 2. Data Visualization and Insights
The dashboard provides insights on various aspects of housing affordability, including:
- Income and Wealth Trends:

  - People who own without a mortgage tend to have more personal wealth, investments, and business assets compared to those who own with a mortgage.
  - Residents from British Columbia lead in personal wealth, investments, and business assets.
  - Individuals aged 55 to 64 have the highest investments, business assets, and overall wealth, while those aged 25 to 34 have the highest personal wealth in housing.
